    <h2>Popular Bible Quotes</h2>
   <h4>“The Lord will keep you from all harm — He will watch over your life; the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.”</h4>
   <p>God promises to always watch over you as you go through life, just like He did with His people as they traveled to Jerusalem.</p>

   <h4>“For we live by faith, not by sight.”</h4>
   <p>In life, not everything is what it seems. Instead of honing down on how you feel about a specific situation and possibly acting impulsively, take a deep breath and let your faith help you make a better decision.</p>

   <h4>“Whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity, and honor.”</h4>
   <p>Those who decide to follow the right path through life will be rewarded in abundance.</p>

   <h4>“Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is — His good, pleasing and perfect will.”</h4>
   


   <h4>“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens.”</h4>
   <p> Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p>

   

   <h4>“Those who guard their lips preserve their lives, but those who speak rashly will come to ruin.”</h4>
   <p>Words can be a powerful weapon, and sometimes it’s best to say nothing and hold your tongue to avoid sinning or hurting others.</p>
   
   
   <h4>“Do not say, ‘Why were the old days better than these?’ For it is not wise to ask such questions.”</h4>
   <p>It’s easy to get frustrated about current situations and believe that things used to be better before. This impatience can often lead to sin, so don’t stay in the past too long.</p>
   
   <h4>“When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider this: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, no one can discover anything about their future.”</h4>
   <p> Never rush in life, because God has a plan for you and there’s always time for everything. Don’t precipitate your decisions.</p>
